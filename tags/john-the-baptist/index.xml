It was from December of 1979 and was performed during a midweek Advent service. Pastor Steve dressed up as John the Baptist and gave his sermon as if he had traveled through time to Wausau in 1979. The service is called &amp;ldquo;An evening with John the Baptist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
