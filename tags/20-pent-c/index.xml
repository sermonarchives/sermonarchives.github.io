There are red X marks next to two paragraphs in this sermon, so it is possible that those paragraphs were ommitted from the sermon when it was preached. There are also a few handwritten corrections. It was preached at &lt;a href="http://www.seymourfaith.org/">Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Seymour, WI&lt;/a>, as the church is mentioned by name in the sermon.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Pharisee and the Tax Collector</title><link>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/the-pharisee-and-the-tax-collector-1974-0079/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 02:59:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/the-pharisee-and-the-tax-collector-1974-0079/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This sermon was actually untitled, so I made a title up for this archive.
