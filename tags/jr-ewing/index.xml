There are red X marks next to two paragraphs in this sermon, so it is possible that those paragraphs were ommitted from the sermon when it was preached. There are also a few handwritten corrections. It was preached at &lt;a href="http://www.seymourfaith.org/">Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Seymour, WI&lt;/a>, as the church is mentioned by name in the sermon.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
