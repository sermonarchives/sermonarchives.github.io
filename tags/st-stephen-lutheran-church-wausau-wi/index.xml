It was from December of 1979 and was performed during a midweek Advent service. Pastor Steve dressed up as John the Baptist and gave his sermon as if he had traveled through time to Wausau in 1979. The service is called &amp;ldquo;An evening with John the Baptist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This Meal of Hope and Thanks</title><link>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/this-meal-of-hope-and-thanks-1980-0101/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 03:44:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/this-meal-of-hope-and-thanks-1980-0101/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This is another example of a &amp;ldquo;same name, different sermon&amp;rdquo; sermon. It has the same name as the previous sermon from 1975, but this one is typed and from 1980. There are also notes in light blue ink.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Givers' Arena</title><link>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/the-givers-arena-1987-0099/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 00:23:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/the-givers-arena-1987-0099/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This is an All Saints Day sermon from 1987. The sermon includes several references, including a very interesting story about a woman that I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard about before.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
