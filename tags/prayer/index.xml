I found this one on a floppy disk with the file name 5EPIPHB.94. There&amp;rsquo;s a chance that I have a paper copy of this sermon, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A World of Widows</title><link>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/a-world-of-widows-1989-0078/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:19:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/a-world-of-widows-1989-0078/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This is a typed sermon with some highlighting and underlining in yellow and red, as well as some corrections in blue pen. It is a sermon from 22 Pentecost and was preached in November of 1989. Technically, Luke 18 is now a part of 19 Pent C in the RCL.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prayer Is Friend Talk</title><link>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/prayer-is-friend-talk-19xx-0076/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 23:29:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/prayer-is-friend-talk-19xx-0076/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This is an undated, typed sermon with a handwritten closing, as well as some handwritten corrections. I&amp;rsquo;m going to guess this as coming from 1973? It was originally listed as being from Trinity XXI, but that was crossed out and 22 Pentecost C was written over it. Technically, Luke 18 is now a part of 19 Pent C in the RCL.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
