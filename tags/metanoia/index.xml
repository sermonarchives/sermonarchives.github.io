I found this one on a floppy disk with the file name ASHWED.96 in an old WordPerfect format. There&amp;rsquo;s a chance that I have a paper copy of this sermon, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet. I do remember hearing the story about the basketball coach when I was a teenager, though.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prepare the Way</title><link>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/prepare-the-way-19xx-0087/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 03:33:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sermonarchives.github.io/sermons/prepare-the-way-19xx-0087/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This sermon is a combination of typing and handwriting in red and black ink. It lists a date, but not a year. Since Advent 2 is listed, we can assume that it was a Sunday, so this sermon was probably preached in 1973 or 1979, since those are two years that 12/9 was on a Sunday.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
